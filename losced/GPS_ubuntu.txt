## Bus 002 Device 020: ID 091e:0003 Garmin International GPS (various models)

dmesg 

## New USB device found, idVendor=091e, idProduct=0003

lsmod | grep gps


## no gps module found, which I gather is good. 

sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf 

## check permissions of the gps/usb

ls -al /dev/bus/usb/001/* 

## permissions are for root and plugdev. 

## I think I set that group earlier. Details in the docs in the GPS manual folder

## generally, use usermod:
## usermod -a -G examplegroup exampleusername

groups

## yup, I am a member of plugdev. 

sudo leafpad /etc/udev/rules.d/51-garmin.rules 

cd /etc/udev/rules.d

## we need the idVendor and idProduct to fill out our rules...
## where to we get this?

lsusb

##  ID field from lsusb is the  idVender:idProduct, I think:

lsusb -d 091e:0003

## garmin idVendor = "091e"
## idProduct = "0003"

## create a rules file to handle garmin gpses when plugged 

sudo vim 51-garmin.rules

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="091e", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0003" MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"

## unplug, replug, see if it worked:

ls -Ral /dev/bus/usb/

## looks like it's in 002:

ls -al /dev/bus/usb/002/*

## /dev/bus/usb/002/022
## group is still plugdev

## didn't do this, but may want to in the future, if the computer
## starts turning off our GPS without asking:

## create the following file? haven't tested any of this. 
sudo vim /etc/default/tlp

## add the following to this file:
USB_BLACKLIST="091e:0003"

## installed gpsbabel. to check to see if a gps is reading:

gpsbabel -i garmin -f usb:-1

## to start the gui:

gpsbabelfe


## some qgis notes

## making 
## convert elevations to strings? needed the following
## on the new string column in the attribute table 

replace(( to_string( ( round( "yourfield", 2)))), '.', ',')

## then used the following on the filter:

"elev_str" LIKE '%00'


## getting website with wget:

wget \
     --recursive \
     --html-extension \
     --convert-links \
     --no-parent \

## try exporting our raw contours to osm using josm

## them try using mkgmap to make an image file

## what is the first step?

## save our contours to osm format using josm

## done, now? mkgmap:

mkgmap contour.osm

## that did something. Now how do we look at it?

## we need to use the usb mass storage mode... 
## 1 - find the gps 

lsusb ## Bus 002 Device 013

## this means, for my computer:

cd /dev/bus/usb/002

## but this isn't how we find this device.

## I think we have to mount the GPS...

sudo mount 013 ~/foo
## doesn't work:
## mount: /home/daniel/foo: /dev/bus/usb/002/013 is not a block device.

## diff of with gps in vs gps out, in usb bulk storage mode:
99,100d98
< sdb
< sdb1
103d100
< sg2

## not sure if any of these are important...

## try mounting one:

sudo mount sdb1 ~/foo
sudo mount sdb ~/foo_sdb
## says already mounted. 
## Where? 

## is this our GPS? Not sure. 

## try putting a map on there:

ls -lr > 
/home/daniel/Documents/LosCed/Ecuador_GIS/losced/ASTGTM2_N00W079/losced_contours/63240001.img \
/home/daniel/foo/Garmin


## okay, can't find that on the gps. 
## but the file dissappeared :
## some lit is saying that we need to upload
## a "gmapsupp.img" file, also. 

## try this with mkgmap:

cd /home/daniel/Documents/LosCed/Ecuador_GIS/losced/ASTGTM2_N00W079/losced_contours

mkgmap contour.osm --gmapsupp


cp \
/home/daniel/Documents/LosCed/Ecuador_GIS/losced/ASTGTM2_N00W079/losced_contours/gmapsupp.img \
/home/daniel/foo/Garmin

sudo umount sdb1 

## works, sort of. Outline of the map appears where it needs to be. 

## is this because of how we drew our map on JOSM?

## not sure. 

## tonight - try to get points (and tracks??) onto the computer

## so switch gears, play around with GPSbabel

############ add waypoints to GPS ##########################

## can we add the lodge as a waypoint from our maps?

gpsbabel -i garmin -f usb:-1

## works

## start gui:

gpsbabelfe &

## I have some points on the gps I would like to put on a 
## map on the computer... how to do this?

mkdir ~/Desktop/foo

findmnt

## okay, waypoints and tracks are apparently not held in the bulk usb 
## memory. Where are they?




## start over. get list of devices before gps is plugged in:

cd /dev 

ls > ~/noGps.txt

## with gps in, not in bulk usb mode:

gpsbabel -i garmin -f usb:-3

ls > ~/withGps.txt

## and in bulk GPS mode:

ls > ~/withUSB.txt


## so what is the difference between GPS and no GPS?

diff ~/noGps.txt ~/withGps.txt

## no difference

diff ~/noGps.txt ~/withUSB.txt

## as above:
97a98,99
> sdc
> sdc1
99a102
> sg2


sudo mount sdb ~/foo

## this is already mounted. Where?

find / -name "Garmin"

## /media/daniel/3730-6465/Garmin

cd /media/daniel/3730-6465/Garmin

## is this where we want to be?
## nope, this is the stuff we previously
## put on, map image files etc. 


sudo mount sdc1 ~/foo

## these are the same, sdc and sdc1

sudo umount sdc1 ~/foo

## what about sg2?

sudo mount sdc1 ~/foo

sudo umount sdc1 

sudo mount sg2  ~/foo

## not a memory device. Fuck, where are our waypoints?

gpsbabel -i garmin -f usb:-1 

gpsbabel -i garmin -f usb: -o gpx -F blah.gpx
